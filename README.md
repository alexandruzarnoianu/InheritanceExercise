# InheritanceExercise
Homework for the Java Developer Course at Devmind - Inheritance principles exercise

Our homework was to implement a parent-class named "Vehicle" and 3 child-classes describing different types of vehicles.
All the classes have custom methods and properties.

The scope of this exercise was to get familiar with the inheritance principle from OOP and play around with constructors, overriding methods and testing access modifiers.
